*"All you need is a putpixel(), and you can do any kind of CG"* - (2020)


Courtsey of javidx9. Follow him on youtube, seriously. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-yuWVUplUJZvieEligKBkA

Written while following the tutorial.


* This reposository contains code mostly from watching javidx9, all the resemblence is intentional. 
  olcPixelGameEngine is not used because I wanted to do it from my own scratch. So used SDL instead ;p



* The Bresenhams line code is from ssloy TinyRendering tutorial. https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer/wiki/Lesson-1-Bresenham%E2%80%99s-Line-Drawing-Algorithm


* The triangle filling code is from olcPixelGameEngine by javidx9 (was too lazy)
